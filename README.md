Music Genre Classification Deep Learning Project

audio_files and image_files contain .wav files and .png files for 100 songs per genre for each of ten genres. 

cnn.py and softmax.oy contain the main methods used in cnn_run.py and softmax_run.py which, when ran in google colab, should access colab's GPU and run a standard CNN and a neural network with a sofmtax output respectively. 

logistic_regres also depends on google colab but can be ran on its own.

All other files contain degenerate code or data used for dev purposes.
